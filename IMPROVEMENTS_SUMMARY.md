## ðŸ“‹ Additional Assets Needed

### Images Required

1. `/public/images/og-image.jpg` (1200x630px) - For social media sharing
2. `/public/favicon.ico` - Browser favicon
3. `/public/icon.svg` - Modern SVG icon
4. `/public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180px) - iOS home screen
5. `/public/site.webmanifest` - PWA manifest file

### Placeholder Images to Replace

- All menu items currently reference placeholder paths
- Consider professional food photography for all menu items

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Known Linter Warnings (Non-Critical)

- **Tailwind CSS @ rules**: Expected warnings - these are processed during build
- **Inline styles in promo.tsx/footer.tsx**: Using framer-motion style props for animations (necessary)
- **ARIA boolean expressions**: False positives - React correctly converts `!!value` to boolean

### No Functional Impact - These Can Be Ignored

- CSS validator doesn't recognize Tailwind directives (processed at build)
- Some components show "unused import" during development (linting cache issue)
